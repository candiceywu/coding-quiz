## Description
This application, Coding Quiz, was created with the purpose of quizzing the user with some JavaScript questions, and then storing their answers as high scores for future play. 

This project took a lot of of time to develop, and I learned a lot about functions and how they can also be nested within one another, and how each one impacts another depending on their positioning. I realized I need a lot of studying for local storage. 

## Installation
For installation and deployment, please [click here](https://candiceywu.github.io/secure-password-generator/). The application should launch with all windows prompts active. 

## Usage
When loaded for the first time, the application will introduce the quiz, including the timer and rules. When the user clicks the 'start' button, the quiz and timer begins. With each answer, a "correct!" or "incorrect!" will show up to notify the user whether they answered the question right or wrong. After all five questions are answered, the user will be shown how many questions they answered correctly. The application *should* then prompt the user to enter their intiials to log into the quiz's highscores section and log their scores for future view and have the option to play the quiz again, but unfortunately I was not able to get local storage functions to work properly for this.

The following image shows the web application's appearance:
